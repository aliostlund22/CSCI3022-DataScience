    "In every homework assignment we'll give you a Challenge Problem.  Challenge Problems never need to be turned in (and in fact, will not be graded) but we encourage you to give them a shot (after completing the required homework problems) and discuss them with your classmates and your instructors. \n",

    "You’re on the north shore of a river, and want to cross to the south, via a series of 13 bridges and six islands, which you can see in the diagram below. But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)\n",
